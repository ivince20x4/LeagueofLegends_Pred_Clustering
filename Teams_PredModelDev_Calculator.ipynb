The StackingCVClassifier, however, uses the concept of cross-validation: the dataset is split into k folds, and in k successive rounds, k-1 folds are used to fit the first level classifier; in each round, the first-level classifiers are then applied to the remaining 1 subset that was not used for model fitting in each iteration. The resulting predictions are then stacked and provided -- as input data -- to the second-level classifier.
